            <p>All guests travelling to our resorts aged 18 or over are required to provide identification on arrival. Failure to provide identification (as specified above), if asked will lead to refusal of entry to our resorts. In addition, for every guest on the booking we must have the full name, date of birth, full postal address including post code, contact telephone number and with your consent, an email address so that we can keep all parties informed of our pre-arrival guides, this is inclusive of up to date entertainment information about your break and future offers.

        <button class="accordion_button">Do we have to pay a deposit against our apartment/room on arrival?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, £100 per room/apartment on the booking will be pre-authorised when you check in. We reserve the right to charge you during or after your stay for any loss or damage to our property.

For group bookings of 19+, you will be asked to give us the lead accommodation guests names before your arrival on resort. This will be made via your debit or credit card. Your card will not be debited unless damages to your accommodation or that of our property are caused. The authorisation from your bank will last for up to 7 days and will impact the availability or access to the amount of funds authorised by your Bank or Building Society. We reserve the right to enter accommodation at any time and for any reason, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all of our guests. Butlin’s reserves the right to require that any guest be interviewed by us, on Butlin’s premises, to enable us to look into instances of damage or nuisance to Butlin’s property or guests. Any person who refuses to comply, without a reasonable excuse, will be treated as having terminated their contract. They and their party will then be asked to leave the resort immediately and refunds will not be given. We reserve the right of entry to our resorts, and the right to refuse entry to our resorts without notice. Guests are advised not to bring electrical appliances to any resort, If they do so, they use the equipment at their own risk.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="panel">
            <p>Yes, we'll be issuing you with wristbands on your arrival at check-in. It is your responsibility to ensure that you look after and wear your wristband at all times whilst on resort. Guests without wristbands will be refused entry to venues and may be required to leave the resort without refund. If your wristband breaks, bring the broken wristband to us and we will replace it free of charge. If you lose your wristband, you will be charged £100 for a new one.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion_button">Do party leaders collect all wristbands for their booking?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Unlike previous Southport Weekenders, all guests must be present when checking in so that photo ID can be checked. Party Leaders cannot collect wristbands for their guests.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion_button">Can you re-sell wristbands?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Anyone found to be offering the resale of wristbands prior or during the break will lead to the booking being cancelled for both the individual involved and anyone associated to the booking, if identified whilst on resort you will be asked to leave, with no offer of a refund for any time missed on resort.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion_button">What is the venue's policy on behaviour and compliance?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>To ensure that a safe and secure environment is provided for all of our guests and team, we ask that you please show consideration to others and treat people and our facilities with respect at all times. Offensive, illegal, or any form of anti social behaviour including excessive noise will not be tolerated. If guests fail to comply with these rules at any point throughout their contract it will be terminated. They and their party will have their booking cancelled prior to arrival and or during their stay whilst on resort, without refund. These are standards that we expect from our guests from the moment they contact us, throughout their break and during any post-break communications. Contracts will also be terminated if Butlin’s has a reasonable suspicion that any guest has committed, or intends to commit any of the above.</p>
